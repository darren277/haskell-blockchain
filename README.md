# Some initial plans (with help from GPT):

To structure your Haskell blockchain prototype project efficiently and execute the program, follow these steps, which will help you organize your code, manage dependencies, and run your application.

# 1. Directory Structure

Here's a suggested directory structure:
```
haskell-blockchain/
├── app/
│   └── Main.hs
├── src/
│   └── Blockchain.hs
├── test/
│   └── Spec.hs
├── haskell-blockchain.cabal
├── stack.yaml
└── Setup.hs
```

`app/Main.hs`: The entry point of your application. It will import your blockchain module from src/ and run the main application logic.
`src/Blockchain.hs`: Contains the blockchain logic, including data structures and functions for creating and manipulating the blockchain.
`test/Spec.hs`: For any tests you want to write using a framework like Hspec.
h`askell-blockchain.cabal`: Cabal file describing your application's properties, dependencies, and build information.
`stack.yaml`: (Optional) If you're using Stack, this file will configure the project's stack tool settings.
`Setup.hs`: Used by Cabal, typically a boilerplate file for simple projects.

# 2. Initializing the Project

You can initialize the project using either Cabal or Stack. These tools help manage dependencies, build processes, and package configurations.

## Using Cabal
Install GHC and Cabal if you haven't already.
Navigate to your project directory and run:
`cabal init`

Follow the interactive prompts to set up your project. You can choose the executable type when prompted, as this project is an application.
Add your dependencies to the generated .cabal file. For this project, you might need base, time, and cryptonite for cryptographic functions.

## Using Stack
Install Stack if you haven't already.
Navigate to project directory and run:
`stack new haskell-blockchain simple`

This command creates a new project using the "simple" template.
Update the stack.yaml and haskell-blockchain.cabal files with your project's dependencies.

# 3. Writing the Program
Populate src/Blockchain.hs with your blockchain logic.
Implement the main application logic in app/Main.hs, which will interact with your blockchain.

# 4. Building and Running the Project

## Using Cabal

Build project:
`cabal build`

Run project:
`cabal run`

## Using Stack

Build project:
`stack build`

Run project:
`stack exec haskell-blockchain-exe`

Replace haskell-blockchain-exe with the name of your executable defined in the Cabal file if you are using a different name.

# 5. Next Steps
As you develop, you might add or modify functions in Blockchain.hs.

Consider adding a simple CLI (Command Line Interface) to interact with your blockchain, using libraries like optparse-applicative.

Expand your test suite in test/Spec.hs to ensure your blockchain behaves as expected under different conditions.


This structure and setup guide gives you a foundational start. As you progress, you might find ways to refine and expand your project based on your learning and the project's evolving requirements.
